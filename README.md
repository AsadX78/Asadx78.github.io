Hi, I'm Asad—a passionate Front End Developer with a knack for creating engaging, responsive web experiences.

I specialize in building modern interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My focus is on clean code, smooth user interactions, and mobile-first design. Whether it’s a portfolio site, a dashboard, or a dynamic web app, I enjoy turning ideas into pixel-perfect reality.

I’m always learning new technologies and design trends, and I love collaborating on open source projects. Currently, I’m deepening my skills in Next.js and TypeScript.

Outside of coding, I enjoy solving puzzles, exploring UI/UX design, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
